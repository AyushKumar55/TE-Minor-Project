# TE-Minor-Project

We can’t change the society totally but we can increase the security of girls by using modern
technology. If women could seek for help with an SOS signal to their closed ones, such as parents,
friends, relatives, neighbours, etc. it would bring courage and a ray of light/hope in a woman on such
encounter.<br> 
The proposed system for women consists of a alerting device which operates when push
button is pressed. Here the security/alerting feature for the women is provided by the continuous
monitoring of her location by the GPS Module. Once the button is pressed, a HELP message with
Google Map location URL on registered contact numbers will be sent. Those contacts could just click
on the URL received in their mobile’s chat box, track her location and go out for help.
